- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arthur! I learned to programm in 2010 and never stopped eversince. Most of the stuff I programmed were for the university and for my job,
but I also fiddled around a lot with Arduino projects at home.
- Nowadays I am more into Python. I am learning it and having a great time.
- Some Projects:
  - Youtube Playlist showcase. (Imersao Alura): https://alura-tube-rho.vercel.app/
  - By 2014 I made my own game: https://arthurpc02.itch.io/
